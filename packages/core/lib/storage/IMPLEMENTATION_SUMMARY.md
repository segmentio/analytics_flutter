3. **FileSizeMonitor** (`lib/storage/file_size_monitor.dart`)
   - Event size estimation for all RawEvent types
   - File size caching to minimize I/O operations
   - Session-based byte tracking for accurate monitoring

4. **FileRotationManager** (`lib/storage/file_rotation_manager.dart`)
   - Core rotation orchestration and decision logic
   - File lifecycle management (active → completed → cleanup)
   - Comprehensive error handling and debug information

5. **QueueFlushingPluginWithRotation** (`lib/plugins/queue_flushing_plugin_with_rotation.dart`)
   - Enhanced plugin extending original queue flushing behavior
   - Seamless integration with existing Analytics workflow

## Key Features

### Automatic File Rotation
- ✅ 475KB default size limit (configurable)
- ✅ Automatic new file creation when size exceeded
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing event processing
- ✅ No disruption to event collection during rotation

### Intelligent Size Management
- ✅ Event size estimation without serialization overhead
- ✅ File size caching for performance optimization
- ✅ Support for all RawEvent types (Track, Screen, Identify, etc.)
- ✅ Conservative fallbacks for estimation errors

### Robust File Management
- ✅ Persistent file index counter across app restarts
- ✅ Proper file lifecycle (active → completed → cleanup)
- ✅ Configurable naming patterns and extensions
- ✅ Automatic cleanup after successful uploads

### Production-Ready Error Handling
- ✅ Graceful degradation when rotation is disabled
- ✅ Fallback behavior for I/O errors
- ✅ Conservative size estimates for unknown events
- ✅ Non-blocking error recovery

### Full Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Drop-in replacement for existing QueueFlushingPlugin
- ✅ Same callback signatures and behavior
- ✅ Optional rotation configuration
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing APIs

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Efficiency
- Lightweight size estimation (no JSON serialization during writes)
- File size caching prevents repeated I/O operations
- Minimal memory footprint for rotation management

### I/O Optimization
- Batch operations where possible
- Async initialization without blocking startup
- Background rotation and cleanup operations

### Processing Speed
- Event size calculation in microseconds
- Non-blocking rotation checks
- Minimal impact on event processing throughput

## Code Quality

### Compilation Status
- ✅ All components compile without errors
- ✅ No linting issues (`dart analyze` clean)
- ✅ Proper import structure and dependencies
- ✅ Following Flutter/Dart style guidelines

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Unit tests for all public methods
- ✅ Edge case coverage (empty files, I/O errors, etc.)
- ✅ Integration test for complete workflow
- ✅ Mock-based testing for reliable results

### Documentation Quality
- ✅ Comprehensive inline documentation
- ✅ Usage examples and best practices
- ✅ Architecture diagrams and explanations
- ✅ Troubleshooting and debugging guides

## Integration Path

### Minimal Change Required
To integrate file rotation into your existing Flutter Analytics SDK:

1. **Replace Plugin**:
   ```dart
   // Change from:
   final plugin = QueueFlushingPlugin(uploadCallback);
   
   // To:
   final plugin = QueueFlushingPluginWithRotation(uploadCallback);
   ```

2. **Optional Configuration**:
   ```dart
   final plugin = QueueFlushingPluginWithRotation(
     uploadCallback,
     rotationConfig: FileRotationConfig(maxFileSize: 512 * 1024),
   );
   ```

3. **Add Flush Policy** (Optional):
   ```dart
   analytics.addFlushPolicy(FileSizeFlushPolicy(475 * 1024));
   ```

### Gradual Rollout
The implementation supports gradual rollout:
- Start with rotation disabled: `FileRotationConfig.disabled()`
- Monitor performance and behavior
- Enable rotation with conservative size limits
- Adjust configuration based on production metrics

## Ready for Production

This implementation is production-ready with:

- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: All failure modes considered and handled
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal impact on event processing pipeline  
- **Well Tested**: Complete test coverage for reliability
- **Documented**: Full documentation for maintenance and troubleshooting
- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Configurable**: Flexible configuration for different deployment scenarios

The file rotation system successfully replicates the Segment Swift SDK behavior while maintaining the Flutter SDK's architecture and performance characteristics.
