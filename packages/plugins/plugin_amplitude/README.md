# segment_analytics_plugin_amplitude

`DestinationPlugin` for [amplitude](https://amplitude.com/docs/sdks/sdk-quickstart). Wraps [`amplitude_analytics`](https://pub.dev/packages/amplitude_analytics).

## Installation

Manually add this package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  analytics_plugin_amplitude:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/segmentio/analytics_flutter
      ref: main
      path: packages/plugins/plugin_amplitude
```

## Usage

Follow the [instructions for adding plugins](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics_flutter_#adding-plugins) on the main Analytics client:

In your code where you initialize the analytics client call the `.add(plugin)` method with an `amplitudeDestination` instance.

```dart
import 'amplitude_options.dart';
import 'package:segment_analytics/client.dart';
import 'package:segment_analytics_plugin_amplitude/plugin_amplitude.dart'
    show amplitudeDestination;

const writeKey = 'SEGMENT_API_KEY';

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  final analytics = createClient(Configuration(writeKey));

  @override
  void initState() {
    // ...

    analytics
        .addPlugin(amplitudeDestination());
  }
}
```
