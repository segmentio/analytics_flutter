In your code where you initialize the analytics client call the `.add(plugin)` method with an `AdvertisingIdDestination` instance. 

```dart
import 'package:segment_analytics/client.dart';
import 'package:segment_analytics_plugin_advertising_id/plugin_advertising_id.dart'
    show PluginAdvertisingId;

const writeKey = 'SEGMENT_API_KEY';

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  final analytics = createClient(Configuration(writeKey));

  @override
  void initState() {
    // ...

    analytics
        .addPlugin(PluginAdvertisingId());
  }
}
```
